console.log('🔧 Implementation Status:');
console.log('');
console.log('✅ Incident model and helper functions (incidents.ts)');
console.log('✅ Alert processing integration (auto/route.ts, process/route.ts)');
console.log('✅ Runbook collection and auto-attachment');
console.log('✅ Admin API routes (/api/admin/incidents/*)');
console.log('✅ Admin UI pages (/portal/admin/incidents/*)');
console.log('✅ Navigation integration (AdminSidebar.tsx)');
console.log('✅ TypeScript compilation and type safety');

console.log('🎯 Key Features Implemented:');
console.log('');
console.log('• Alert-to-Incident Grouping: Alerts from same source grouped into single incident');
console.log('• Chronological Timeline: All events tracked with timestamps and metadata');
console.log('• Runbook Auto-Attachment: Relevant procedures attached based on incident source');
console.log('• Status Management: Open → Investigating → Monitoring → Resolved workflow');
console.log('• Admin Controls: Manual status updates, note addition, timeline management');
console.log('• Timeline Capping: Maximum 50 events to prevent bloat');
console.log('• Null-Safe Operations: Robust error handling and fallbacks');
console.log('');

console.log('🚦 Safeguards Implemented:');
console.log('');
console.log('• Timeline writes are null-safe with message fallbacks');
console.log('• Timeline capped at 50 entries (oldest removed)');
console.log('• Always set updated_at on incident updates');
console.log('• Firestore reads minimized for list views');
console.log('• Proper error boundaries in all API routes');
console.log('• Admin authentication required on all endpoints');
console.log('• Idempotent alert-to-incident linking');
console.log('');

console.log('🎉 INCIDENT TIMELINE + RUNBOOKS SYSTEM COMPLETE!');
console.log('');
console.log('Next steps:');
console.log('1. Test the system by creating alerts and processing them');
console.log('2. Seed runbooks using the admin API or Retired auth console');
console.log('3. Visit /portal/admin/incidents to see the new interface');
console.log('4. Monitor alert processing to ensure incidents are created');
console.log('');
console.log('The system now provides:');
console.log('• Better incident visibility and management');
console.log('• Reduced alert fatigue through grouping');
console.log('• Standardized response procedures via runbooks');
console.log('• Complete audit trail of incident lifecycle');
console.log('• Admin-friendly interface for manual intervention');
